Mars Opportunity Rover Landscape for Stellarium
===============================================

Description
-----------

This is the Opportunity panoramic camera's "Erebus Rim" panorama,
acquired on sols 652 to 663 (Nov. 23 to Dec. 5, 2005 ), as NASA's Mars
Exploration Rover Opportunity was exploring sand dunes and outcrop
rocks in Meridiani Planum. The panorama originally consisted of 635
separate images in 4 different Pancam filters, and covers 360 degrees of
terrain around the rover and the full rover deck. Since the time that
this panorama was acquired, and while engineers have been diagnosing
and testing Opportunity's robotic arm, the panorama has been expanded
to include more than 1,300 images of this terrain through all of the
Pancam multispectral filters. It is the largest panorama acquired by
either rover during the mission.

The panorama shown here is an approximate true-color rendering using
Pancam's 750 nanometer, 530 nanometer and 430 nanometer filters. It is
presented here as a cylindrical projection. Image-to-image seams have
been eliminated from the sky portion of the mosaic to better simulate
the vista a person standing on Mars would see.

This panorama provides the team's highest resolution view yet of the
finely-layered outcrop rocks, wind ripples, and small cobbles and grains
along the rim of the wide but shallow "Erebus" crater. Once the arm
diagnostics and testing are completed, the team hopes to explore other
layered outcrop rocks at Erebus and then eventually continue southward
toward the large crater known as "Victoria."
