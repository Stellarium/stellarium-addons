Cap Masoala (Madagascar) Landscape for Stellarium
=================================================

Description
-----------

This panoramic view from the top of the abandoned French lighthouse 
at Cap Masoala in Madagascar was shot 2005 by Matthias D. Frei. 
The Masoala peninsula in NE-Madagascar is still mainly covered with 
rainforest. 
The old lighthouse positioned at the far south of the peninsula 
provides a spectacular view over the Indian Ocean and the Masoala 
peninsula.

Additional information from the author: 
The sky above the rainforest is very often covered with clouds, 
therefore I added some manually after having removed the real sky. 
They just give you a more realistic impression without really affecting 
the view to the stars.
I created the ground texture in Adobe Photoshop trying to give you 
the feeling standing on the top of the old lighthouse.
